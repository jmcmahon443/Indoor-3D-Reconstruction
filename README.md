# Indoor-3D-Reconstruction
The goal is to implement existing algorithms for SLAM and 3D indoor reconstruction on an open source quadrotor. The visual reconstruction of the environment will be done using an on board set of stereo cameras and the information acquired by the camera will be transmitted to the user via WiFi. This project will be useful in a variety of applications including construction as-builts and audits, search and rescue, and disaster response.
